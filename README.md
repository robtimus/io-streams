# io-streams

A collection of [InputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html), [OutputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html), [Reader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Reader.html) and [Writer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html) implementations. Combined with [Commons IO](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/) this should provide for implementations for most situations.
